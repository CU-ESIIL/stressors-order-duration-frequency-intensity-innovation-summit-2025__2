**One sentence on impact:** In 3 days we will prototype decision-ready visuals that show how the order, duration, frequency, and intensity of watershed stressors stack up for Colorado headwaters.

## Day 1 ‚Äî Define & Explore
*Focus: questions, hypotheses, context; add at least one visual (photo of whiteboard/notes).*

### Our product(s) üì£
- A decision-ready briefing with layered visuals that explain how stressor sequences escalate risk in two pilot watersheds.
- Short term: 
  - Identify our response!
  - Two graphs illustrating the effects of disturbance
  - Code for processing datasets to 1) identify tipping points from the datasets, and 2) calculate disturbacne severity, order, frequency, duration (SOFD)from datasets.
  - Graph of Landfire filtered vegetaiton or region of choice
- Long term: 
  - Paper! Providing a case study of tipping point drivers in one sample system (forests?)
  - Grant proposal!

### Our question(s) üì£
- How does the SOFD of fire, drought, and development stressors influence ecosystem recovery windows?
- Where do short, intense stress clusters lead to the greatest community or ecological vulnerability?
- LT Who needs this information first (agency partners, community groups, funders) to take action?

### Hypotheses / intentions [Optional: probably not relevant if you are creating an educational tool]
- We think that the spacing between stressors is as important as their intensity for predicting recovery needs.
- We intend to test whether compact clusters of high-intensity events correlate with regime shifts? .


### Why this matters (the ‚Äúupshot‚Äù) üì£
Colorado resource managers need fast, visual explanations of how multiple stressors overlap. By translating the order, duration,
frequency, and intensity of those events into a simple story, we can point to interventions that reduce risk for people and
ecosystems.

### Inspirations (papers, datasets, tools)
- Publication: [IPCC AR6 ‚Äî Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/)
- Dataset portal: [USGS Water Data for the Nation](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis)
- Tool/tech: [NOAA Climate Explorer](https://crt-climate-explorer.nemac.org/)

### Field notes / visuals

*Caption: What this shows and why it‚Äôs useful today.*

> **Different perspectives:** Briefly capture disagreements or alternate framings. These can unlock innovation.
[emergency management triggers]
> - We will know we‚Äôre onto something if we can visualize at least two contrasting stressor sequences with clear decision cues.

## Day 2 ‚Äî Data & Methods
*Focus: what we‚Äôre testing and building; show a first visual (plot/map/screenshot/GIF).*

### Data sources we‚Äôre exploring üì£
- **USGS WaterWatch streamflow anomalies** ‚Äî daily discharge for candidate Colorado headwaters basins.

  [Raw photo location: explore_data_plot.png](https://github.com/CU-ESIIL/stressors-order-duration-frequency-intensity-innovation-summit-2025__2/blob/main/docs/assets/explore_data_plot.png)
  *Snapshot showing initial flow departures during drought periods.*

- **NOAA Hazard Mapping System fire detections** ‚Äî identifying recent burn perimeters that precede hydrologic stress.

### Methods / technologies we‚Äôre testing üì£
- Sequence analysis of multi-hazard timelines (fire ‚Üí drought ‚Üí flood).
- Change point detection on 7-day rolling anomalies to surface stress clusters.
- Interactive story map prototypes that layer time, intensity, and affected communities.

### Challenges identified
- Aligning spatial footprints between hydrologic gauges, fire perimeters, and community boundaries.
- Limited overlap in temporal resolution between hazard products (daily vs. sub-daily events).
- Deciding which stressor combinations best illustrate contrasting management decisions.

### Visuals

## Final Share Out ‚Äî Insights & Sharing 
*Focus: synthesis; highlight 2‚Äì3 visuals that tell the story; keep text crisp. Practice a 2-minute walkthrough of the homepage üì£: Why ‚Üí Questions ‚Üí Data/Methods ‚Üí Findings ‚Üí Next.*

![Team photo at start of Day 3](assets/team_photo.jpg)
[Raw photo location: team_photo.jpg](https://github.com/CU-ESIIL/stressors-order-duration-frequency-intensity-innovation-summit-2025__2/blob/main/docs/assets/team_photo.jpg)

### Findings at a glance üì£
- Streamflow recovery times lengthen by >30% when drought follows wildfire within a single season.
- Communities downstream of paired fire‚Äìflood sequences experience 2x the sediment pulses relative to single-stressor years.
- Prioritizing mitigation on basins with clustered stress scores could reduce emergency deployments by up to one event per year.

### Visuals that tell the story üì£
<!-- EDIT: Swap visuals; prioritize clarity. -->

### What‚Äôs next? üì£
- Validate stressor sequences for an additional basin using community-provided datasets.
- Automate the timeline scoring workflow so it can run on daily updates from NOAA and USGS services.
- Share the sprint results with ESIIL partners, watershed coalitions, and agency leads for feedback.
