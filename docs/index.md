**One sentence on impact:** In 3 days we will determine a workflow to evaluate how the order, duration, frequency, and intensity of disturbances affect the likelihood of regime shifts from forests to nonforests.

## Day 1 ‚Äî Define & Explore
*Focus: questions, hypotheses, context; add at least one visual (photo of whiteboard/notes).*

### Our product(s) üì£
- **Short term**: 
  - Identify our response!
  - Two graphs illustrating the effects of disturbance
  - Code for processing datasets to 1) identify tipping points from the datasets, and 2) calculate disturbacne severity, order, frequency, duration (SOFD)from datasets.
  - Graph of Landfire filtered vegetaiton or region of choice
- **Long term**: 
  - Paper! Providing a case study of tipping point drivers in one sample system (forests?)
  - Grant proposal!

### Our question(s) üì£
- How does the FODS of fire, drought, and development stressors influence ecosystem recovery windows?
- Where do short, intense stress clusters lead to the greatest community or ecological vulnerability?
- LT Who needs this information first (agency partners, community groups, funders) to take action?

### Hypotheses / intentions [Optional: probably not relevant if you are creating an educational tool]
- We think that the spacing between stressors is as important as their intensity for predicting recovery needs.
- We intend to test whether compact clusters of high-intensity events correlate with regime shifts? .


### Why this matters (the ‚Äúupshot‚Äù) üì£
Colorado resource managers need fast, visual explanations of how multiple stressors overlap. By translating the order, duration,
frequency, and intensity of those events into a simple story, we can point to interventions that reduce risk for people and
ecosystems.

> **Different perspectives:** Briefly capture disagreements or alternate framings. These can unlock innovation.
[emergency management triggers]
> - We will know we‚Äôre onto something if we can visualize at least two contrasting stressor sequences with clear decision cues.

## Day 2 ‚Äî Data & Methods
*Focus: what we‚Äôre testing and building; show a first visual (plot/map/screenshot/GIF).*

**Study Area: Southern Rockies Ecoregion**   
Spatial extent: a small part of the ecoregion  
Spatial resolution: 30x30m  
Temporal extent: 1999-2024  
Temporal resolution: Annual  
Projection: Albers Equal Area Conic projection (EPSG 9822)

**Response Variables**
1. Was there a regime shift? (Change from forest to nonforest that did not recover within 10 years)
2. If there WAS NOT a regime shift, how long did forests take to recover? 
3. If there WAS a regime shift, what system did the forest transition to? (e.g. grassland, shrubs) 

**Questions:**
- How does the FODS of fire, drought, insects, and their interaction influence forest shifts to non-forest between 1999 and 2024 in the Southern Rockies ecoregion?
- How does the FODS of fire, drought,  insects, and their interaction influence forest recovery between 1999 and 2024 in the Southern Rockies ecoregion?


### Data sources we‚Äôre exploring üì£
<!-- EDIT: Link each source; add size/notes if relevant. -->
 *Snapshot showing initial data patterns.*

Predictors: Frequency, order, duration, severity of   
A) Fire, insect outbreaks from LANDFIRE  
B) Drought measured as SPEI from PRISM  
C) Fire severity from MTBS  
  
### Methods / technologies we‚Äôre testing üì£
- Approach 1 - generalized linear (mixed) models with a binomial response
- Approach 2 - generalized linear (mixed) model with a continuous response
- Visualization (e.g., map tiles, small multiples)

  
### Challenges identified
- We speak different languages - coding, disciplines, chosen technologies
- Gaps in the data
- Computational constraints - working with big data is hard!
- Ensuring models accurately represent our understanding of the system (DAGS)
- Scaling up
- Identifying final predictors (How do we calculate FODS for each disturbance)
- Defining regime shift (Is 10 years long enough?) Need theoretical frameworks!

Refine the DAG  
Run models   
Scale to Southern Rockies/USA
**Moderate term**  
Submit a WG proposal with Group 3  
Include more disturbances
Write up our results and submit as a manuscript  
**Long term**   
Submit a grant proposal with Group 3
