**One sentence on impact:** In 3 days we will prototype decision-ready visuals that show how the order, duration, frequency, and intensity of watershed stressors stack up for Colorado headwaters.

## Day 1 ‚Äî Define & Explore
*Focus: questions, hypotheses, context; add at least one visual (photo of whiteboard/notes).*

### Our product(s) üì£
- A decision-ready briefing with layered visuals that explain how stressor sequences escalate risk in two pilot watersheds.
- Short term: 
  - Identify our response!
  - Two graphs illustrating the effects of disturbance
  - Code for processing datasets to 1) identify tipping points from the datasets, and 2) calculate disturbacne severity, order, frequency, duration (SOFD)from datasets.
  - Graph of Landfire filtered vegetaiton or region of choice
- Long term: 
  - Paper! Providing a case study of tipping point drivers in one sample system (forests?)
  - Grant proposal!

### Our question(s) üì£
- How does the SOFD of fire, drought, and development stressors influence ecosystem recovery windows?
- Where do short, intense stress clusters lead to the greatest community or ecological vulnerability?
- LT Who needs this information first (agency partners, community groups, funders) to take action?

### Hypotheses / intentions [Optional: probably not relevant if you are creating an educational tool]
- We think that the spacing between stressors is as important as their intensity for predicting recovery needs.
- We intend to test whether compact clusters of high-intensity events correlate with regime shifts? .


### Why this matters (the ‚Äúupshot‚Äù) üì£
Colorado resource managers need fast, visual explanations of how multiple stressors overlap. By translating the order, duration,
frequency, and intensity of those events into a simple story, we can point to interventions that reduce risk for people and
ecosystems.

### Inspirations (papers, datasets, tools)
- Publication: [IPCC AR6 ‚Äî Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/)
- Dataset portal: [USGS Water Data for the Nation](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis)
- Tool/tech: [NOAA Climate Explorer](https://crt-climate-explorer.nemac.org/)

> **Different perspectives:** Briefly capture disagreements or alternate framings. These can unlock innovation.
[emergency management triggers]
> - We will know we‚Äôre onto something if we can visualize at least two contrasting stressor sequences with clear decision cues.

## Day 2 ‚Äî Data & Methods
*Focus: what we‚Äôre testing and building; show a first visual (plot/map/screenshot/GIF).*

Questions:
How does the SOFD of fire, drought, and their interaction influence forest shifts to non-forest between 1999 and 2024 in the Southern Rockies ecoregion?
How does the SOFD of fire, drought, and their interaction influence forest recovery between 1999 and 2024 in the Southern Rockies ecoregion?

A) Did a forest shift (within ten years after disturbance or their interactions) and what is the system it shifted to?
B) If forest didn't shift to non-forest, how long did it take to recover to forest?

Spatial extent: a small part of the ecoregion
Spatial resolution: 30x30m
Temporal extent: 1999-2024
Temporal resolution: Annual

### Data sources we‚Äôre exploring üì£
<!-- EDIT: Link each source; add size/notes if relevant. -->
 *Snapshot showing initial data patterns.*

Predictors: Frequency, order, duration, severity of
A) Fire, insect outbreaks from LANDFIRE
B) Drought measured as SPEI from PRISM
C) Fire severity from MTBS

Projection: Albers Equal Area Conic projection
    

### Methods / technologies we‚Äôre testing üì£
- Approach 1 - generalized linear mixed models with a binomial response
- Approach 2 - generalized linear mixed model with a continuous response
- Visualization (e.g., map tiles, small multiples)

### Methods / technologies we‚Äôre testing üì£ /NA
- Sequence analysis of multi-hazard timelines (fire ‚Üí drought ‚Üí flood).
- Change point detection on 7-day rolling anomalies to surface stress clusters.
- Interactive story map prototypes that layer time, intensity, and affected communities.

### Challenges identified
- Gaps in the data
- Compute constraints
- Ensuring models correctly capture what's happening
- Scaling up
  
### Challenges identified/NA
- Aligning spatial footprints between hydrologic gauges, fire perimeters, and community boundaries.
- Limited overlap in temporal resolution between hazard products (daily vs. sub-daily events).
- Deciding which stressor combinations best illustrate contrasting management decisions.

### Visuals
